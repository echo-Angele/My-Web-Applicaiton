## Hi there!! ðŸ‘‹
I'm **echo-Angele** and this is my first web application combination. 
I'm building some simple apps we may use, like ***weather, calculator, exchange rate***, and others.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the third app, which is the ***weather app.*** I'll add more functions like temperature, wind direction, and more.
- ðŸ”­ I'm also making a new version of the ***calculator***. I'm trying to make it more **human-friendly**.
