## Hi there!! ðŸ‘‹
I am **echo-Angele** and this is my first web application combination. 
I am building some simple apps we may use, like ***weather, calculator, exchange rate, and others***.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the third app, which is the ***weather app.*** I will add more functions like temperature, wind direction, and more.
